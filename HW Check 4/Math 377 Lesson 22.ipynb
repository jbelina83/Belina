    "3) Determine distribution of test statistic and compute a $p$-value. If you have taken inferential statistics before, you likely computed a $z$ or $t$ statistic and used a calculator or table to compute a $p$-value. This is based on asymptotic theory of sample means/proportions. This is not the approach taken in Data8.2x. With better computing power, we can use simulation to obtain an empirical distribution of our test statistic under the null hypothesis. \n",
